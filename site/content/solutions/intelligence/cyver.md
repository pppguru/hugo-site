## Cyber Threat Analysis with Diffeo

Discover unknown unknowns in unstructured text by rapidly assembling networks of entities with help from Dffeo’s active learning algorithms for large-scale entity disambiguation. As you take note of interesting relationships, the machine-in-the-loop learns which entities you are studying and suggests texts to fill in knowledge gaps.

As an analyst working cyber threats, I need to correlate the latest intrusion data with OSINT, HUMINT, and other reporting sources to figure out who is attacking and why.

This new approach to discovery [won the NGA’s Disparate Data Challenge!][diffeoapproach]

I quickly organize knowledge base (KB) entries by dragging text from source documents recommended by Diffeo. As I build out my KB article on Sandworm, a recently identified zero-day, Diffeo learns which subtopics I am studying and analyzes the labyrinth of complex data sources to find useful mentions of my entity.

What is useful? The relationships that I did not know about! Diffeo identifies missing connections and makes it easy for me to see them as I iteratively refine the citations and hyperlinks in my evolving KB.

The resulting KB is rich in semantic structure. It is a new collaboration tool for my entire team. The network in the KB quickly revealed that Sandworm is targeting GE Cimplicity. This might affect my organization, so I send the new BlackEnergy indicators to the cyber defenders in the relevant SCADA team.
